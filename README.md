# machine-learning-progress
This just is how i have progressed so far in machine learning 

It shows how I started from the "hello world" of machine learning to the advanced stage
The file y=mx+c shows the fundamental of machine learning. It is an ipynb file. It trys to predict the values of y when x is given. 

Also we can see a file called fashion mnist. This is a classification problem where we have a set of images of clothes and we try to classify the clothes into 't-shirts', 'dresses', 'trousers' etc.
